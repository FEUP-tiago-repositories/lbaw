# SportsHub

The _SportsHub_ system is being developed as a web-based platform that connects people who want flexible sports options with sports facilities and service providers. Unlike traditional long-term membership models, _SportsHub_ allows users to search, book and experience different sports activities anytime, anywhere, without commitments. It bridges the gap between users who want flexibility (such as digital nomads, casual players or people with irregular schedules) and businesses that want to optimize their underused spaces or promote their services in a wider market.
